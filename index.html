		Have you ever felt your brain turn off, leaving you unfocused and inable to think of anything other than why the singular form of deer isn't door?
		<br>
		Do you spend way too much time thinking of ways to convince your friends that some (very false) dumb-sounding things are true?
		<br>
		Here, you aren't alone. I need a lot more sleep, and whatever is on this website will most definitely make that clear. My sleep-deprived brain will write down things like <i> coconuts (or coconut trees, at the very least) should be considered mammals <i>. Enjoy!
